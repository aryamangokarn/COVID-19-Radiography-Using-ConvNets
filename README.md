# COVID-19-Radiography-Using-ConvNets

The COVID-19 pandemic continues to have a negative impact on the fitness and well being of the worldwide population. A vital step in tackling the COVID-19 is a successful screening of patients, with one of the key screening approaches being radiological imaging using chest radiography. This study aims to automatically identify patients with COVID-19 pneumonia using digital x-ray images of the chest while increasing the accuracy of the diagnosis using Convolution Neural networks (CNN).
